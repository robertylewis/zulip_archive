# zulip_archive

A tool for publicly archiving and displaying Zulip chat channels.

Author: [Robert Y. Lewis](https://robertylewis.com/) ([@robertylewis](https://github.com/robertylewis))

The script `archive.py` has two functions:
* It builds a json archive of messages from a Zulip chat room.
* It generates static markdown/html to display these messages.

This is particularly useful when used in combination with Jekyll, to
compile the html/markdown to a functional website. An example of this
can be seen at the [leanprover-community Zulip chat
archive](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/).

This script is provided as-is. Contributions to make it more robust or
more general are very welcome.

## Directions for use

* The script requires Python 3.
* Install the Zulip python bindings, with `pip3 install zulip`.
* [Create a bot](https://zulipchat.com/help/add-a-bot-or-integration)
  and download its
  [zuliprc](https://zulipchat.com/api/configuring-python-bindings)
  file to `zulip_archive/zuliprc` within this project.
* Extend the `zuliprc` file with an `archive` section like this:
    ```
    [archive]
    root_url=file:///home/tabbott/zulip_archive
    # A whitelist of streams; if specified, only these streams will be included.
    stream_whitelist=announce
    # A blacklist of streams; these streams will never be included.
    stream_blacklist=hidden, other hidden
    # The title of the archive
    title=Lean Prover Zulip Chat Archive
    ```
* Optionally, modify the display generation code to fit your needs. The
  defaults are based on the [leanprover-community Jekyll
  setup](https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io).

* Run `python3 archive.py` with the following options:
  * `-t` builds a fresh archive. This will download every message from the Zulip chat and might take a long time. Must be run at least once before using `-i`.
  * `-i` updates the archives with messages posted since the last scrape.
  * `-b` generates the markdown/html output.
  * `-f` updates the git repository containing the script, and `-p` pushes the generated files. Useful if the script is generating a static site hosted using GitHub Pages.
